# Review 1/6/22 - Git Conflict Resolution

A conflict arises when you attempt to merge two different branches that have different lines of code in the same files of the latest commits you are attempting to merge.

## How can we resolve a merge conflict?

Use VS Code's difftool interface to manually resolve (delete, add, update, etc) the lines of code that caused the conflict, AND COMMIT.
